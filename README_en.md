Lightweight, flexible, and modern programming language.

Riddle Language is a memory-safe programming language designed to replace Rust.

## Note

Riddle is still incomplete and is in the early stages of development.

## Features

- Memory Safety: Riddle Language guarantees memory safety at compile-time, eliminating common programming errors such as
  null pointer dereferences and buffer overflows. This ensures robust and secure software.
- High Performance: Riddle Language combines safety with high-performance execution, making it suitable for
  resource-intensive applications. It achieves this through advanced optimizations and a carefully designed runtime
  system.
- Conciseness and Expressiveness: Riddle Language provides a clean and expressive syntax that promotes readability and
  code maintainability. It offers modern language constructs, powerful abstractions, and a rich set of libraries to
  streamline development.
- Concurrency and Parallelism: Riddle Language has built-in support for concurrent and parallel programming. It offers
  lightweight threads, asynchronous programming models, and synchronization primitives to simplify the development of
  scalable and efficient applications.
- Interoperability: Riddle Language seamlessly integrates with existing codebases and libraries written in other
  languages. It provides easy bindings to C and C++ and supports interoperability with popular frameworks and
  ecosystems.
